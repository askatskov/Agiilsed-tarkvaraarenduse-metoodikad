    <h1>Incremental Development Model</h1>
   
    <p>
        The incremental development model is a strategy where 
        software is developed gradually and according to a 
        fixed schedule. During each phase, a part of the 
        system is developed and integrated into the already 
        existing system.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Requirements Analysis: In the first stage of the incremental 
                model, system requirements are defined. The goal of this 
                phase is to understand the software's functionality and 
                identify what features the system must have.
            </li>
            <li>
                Design and Development: This phase focuses on designing the 
                system architecture and initiating the development process. 
                The incremental model allows new features to be added
                sequentially, making each finished part a functional 
                addition to the system.
            </li>
            <li>
                Testing: Each developed function is tested to ensure it works 
                correctly. Every added part is tested and verified beforehand 
                to ensure the system's reliability.
            </li>
            <li>
                Implementation: In the implementation phase, final coding 
                and functionality testing are performed. Once the system is 
                ready, final tests are conducted before the system is fully 
                deployed and enhanced.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p> The incremental development model is based on sequential 
            stages, where each new stage builds upon the previous one 
            and adds new features to the system. All stages focus on 
            specific tasks, including requirement definition, system 
            design, software development, testing, and final 
            implementation.</p>

    <p><strong>Iterative Development Model<p></strong>

    <p>
        The iterative development model is a strategy where 
        software development occurs repeatedly through iterations, 
        where each iteration allows enhancement and improvement 
        based on previous experience.
    </p>

    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Requirements Analysis and Planning: At the beginning of the 
                first iteration, core system requirements are defined. Initial 
                specifications are created, and development priorities are 
                set to start working iteratively.
            </li>
            <li>
                Design and Prototyping: Next, the system architecture is 
                designed, and early prototypes are created. During each
                iteration, the architecture is developed and improved, 
                and new components are added, allowing for early user 
                feedback.
            </li>
            <li>
                Development and Testing: Each iteration includes development, 
                testing, and bug fixing. After adding new functionality, 
                thorough testing is conducted to ensure system reliability 
                and stability.
            </li>
            <li>
                Feedback and Improvement: At the end of the iteration, 
                feedback is collected from users and clients, based on 
                which necessary changes are made. This iterative approach 
                enables continuous improvement and adjustment of the 
                system to meet changing requirements.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p> The iterative development model is based on a repeated 
            approach, where each iteration allows improving and enhancing 
            the system based on prior experience. All phases focus on 
            constant feedback, analysis, software development, and 
            refinement to ultimately achieve a stable and high-quality 
            system.</p>

    <p><strong>Difference Between Incremental and Iterative<p></strong>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <p><strong>Iterative Development<p></strong>
            <li>
                Focus is on improvement.
            </li>
            <li>
                You start with something simple (a prototype, 
                rough version) and improve/refine it with each 
                iteration.
            </li>
            <li>
                The goal is to learn, experiment, and produce 
                increasingly better versions based on user feedback.
            </li>
            <li>
                Example: We build a simple app that only displays 
                a list. In the next iteration, we add the ability 
                to edit the list. Then sorting. Then search. Each 
                iteration improves the existing functionality.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <p><strong>Incremental Development<p></strong>
            <li>
                Focus is on adding new functionality.
            </li>
            <li>
                You start with a small part of the 
                system and gradually add new parts step-by-step.
            </li>
            <li>
                Each new increment means new functionality that could 
                be used independently.
            </li>
            <li>
                Example: First, we create user login. Then we 
                add a profile page. Then messaging. Each new 
                part is a new piece (increment) that expands 
                the system's capabilities.
            </li>
        </ol>
