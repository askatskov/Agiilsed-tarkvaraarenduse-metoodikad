    <h1>Incremental Development Model</h1>
   
    <p>
        The incremental development model is a strategy where<br> 
        software is developed gradually and according to a<br> 
        fixed schedule. During each phase, a part of the<br> 
        system is developed and integrated into the already<br> 
        existing system.<br><br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Requirements Analysis: In the first stage of the incremental<br> 
                model, system requirements are defined. The goal of this<br> 
                phase is to understand the software's functionality and<br> 
                identify what features the system must have.<br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                Design and Development: This phase focuses on designing the<br> 
                system architecture and initiating the development process.<br> 
                The incremental model allows new features to be added<br>
                sequentially, making each finished part a functional<br> 
                addition to the system.<br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                Testing: Each developed function is tested to ensure it works<br> 
                correctly. Every added part is tested and verified beforehand<br> 
                to ensure the system's reliability.<br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                Implementation: In the implementation phase, final coding<br> 
                and functionality testing are performed. Once the system is<br> 
                ready, final tests are conducted before the system is fully<br> 
                deployed and enhanced.<br><br>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p> The incremental development model is based on sequential<br> 
            stages, where each new stage builds upon the previous one<br> 
            and adds new features to the system. All stages focus on<br> 
            specific tasks, including requirement definition, system<br> 
            design, software development, testing, and final<br> 
            implementation.<br><br></p>

    <h1>Iterative Development Model</h1>

    <p>
        The iterative development model is a strategy where<br> 
        software development occurs repeatedly through iterations,<br> 
        where each iteration allows enhancement and improvement<br> 
        based on previous experience.<br><br>
    </p>

    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Requirements Analysis and Planning: At the beginning of the<br> 
                first iteration, core system requirements are defined. Initial<br> 
                specifications are created, and development priorities are<br> 
                set to start working iteratively.<br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                Design and Prototyping: Next, the system architecture is<br> 
                designed, and early prototypes are created. During each<br>
                iteration, the architecture is developed and improved,<br> 
                and new components are added, allowing for early user<br> 
                feedback.<br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                Development and Testing: Each iteration includes development,<br> 
                testing, and bug fixing. After adding new functionality,<br> 
                thorough testing is conducted to ensure system reliability<br> 
                and stability.<br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                Feedback and Improvement: At the end of the iteration,<br> 
                feedback is collected from users and clients, based on<br> 
                which necessary changes are made. This iterative approach<br> 
                enables continuous improvement and adjustment of the<br> 
                system to meet changing requirements.<br><br>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p> The iterative development model is based on a repeated<br> 
            approach, where each iteration allows improving and enhancing<br> 
            the system based on prior experience. All phases focus on<br> 
            constant feedback, analysis, software development, and<br> 
            refinement to ultimately achieve a stable and high-quality<br> 
            system.<br><br></p>

    <h1>Difference Between Incremental and Iterative</h1>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <h2>Iterative Development</h2>
            <li>
                Focus is on improvement.
            </li>
            <li>
                You start with something simple (a prototype,<br> 
                rough version) and improve/refine it with each<br> 
                iteration.<br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                The goal is to learn, experiment, and produce<br> 
                increasingly better versions based on user feedback.<br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                Example: We build a simple app that only displays<br> 
                a list. In the next iteration, we add the ability<br> 
                to edit the list. Then sorting. Then search. Each<br> 
                iteration improves the existing functionality.<br><br>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <h2>Incremental Development</h2>
            <li>
                Focus is on adding new functionality.
            </li>
            <li>
                You start with a small part of the<br> 
                system and gradually add new parts step-by-step.<br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                Each new increment means new functionality that could<br> 
                be used independently.<br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                Example: First, we create user login. Then we<br> 
                add a profile page. Then messaging. Each new<br> 
                part is a new piece (increment) that expands<br> 
                the system's capabilities.<br><br>
